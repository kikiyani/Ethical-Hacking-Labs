Advanced Google hacking refers to the art of creating complex search engine queries by employing advanced Google operators to extract sensitive or hidden information about a target company from the Google search results.




########################################
We use Google keywords/advance operators to do this, here the keyword intitle helps the ethical hacker search a specific page like Conatct, login along with the target website, This can help the attacker depending on the search for example incase of login
pages the attacker can carry out attacks like brute force or injection attacks.

#########################################
Here, the file type pdf is searched for the target organization. The result might differ when you perform this task. The PDF and other documents from a target website may provide sensitive information about the target's products and services. They
may help attackers to determine an attack vector to exploit the target.

########################################
Shows Google’s cached copy of a page (what Google stored when it last crawled).
Example: cache:example.com
Attacker benefit: Can reveal previous/removed content (old pages, debug output, credentials accidentally published and later removed). Useful to recover deleted files or versions.

#######################################
Returns pages whose URL contains all of the listed words.
Example: allinurl:example career finds URLs with both example and career in the path.
Attacker benefit: Quickly locates admin pages, careers portals, or directories that match multiple URL tokens (e.g., allinurl:admin backup). Useful to find exposed admin panels or backups.

#######################################
Returns pages with the specified word somewhere in the URL.
Example: inurl:copy site:example.com — pages on example.com with copy in the URL.
Attacker benefit: Finds pages that may contain copy/backups, file-download endpoints, or developer artifacts (inurl:backup, inurl:old, inurl:dev).

#######################################
An allintitle: document search query would look for web pages containing the word "document" in their title and also in their content. Locates documentation, support pages, or reports containing those exact tokens — 
useful for discovering technical docs or admin pages that reveal infrastructure or software versions.

#######################################
This operator restricts results to pages containing all query terms specified in the anchor text on links to the page.
Query returns only pages in which the anchor text on links to the pages contain the words "best," "cloud," "service," and "provider". Helpful in mapping marketing claims, partnerships, 
or PR items that can reveal third-party relationships or product names that can be targeted.

####################################
When you type link:example.com in Google, it shows you pages that contain a hyperlink to example.com.
So you’re not searching inside example.com — you’re searching for other sites that point to it. Attacker benefit: Reveals inbound links — helpful for mapping partner sites, mirrors, or references that may host leaked content. 
Can expose less-secure third parties that link to you (supply-chain attack surface).

####################################
Returns websites that Google considers similar to the provided domain.
Attacker benefit: Can reveal competitors, partner sites, or sites in the same hosting cluster 
useful for supply-chain reconnaissance or discovering other exposed assets run by the same org.

####################################
What it does: Shows Google’s summary info about a URL (cached, similar pages, indexed pages).
Attacker benefit: Quick snapshot of what Google knows about the target (indexed pages, cached versions). Useful for mapping the attack surface.

##################################
Restricts results to a particular geographic location (Google may use local results and country variants). Attacker benefit: Enables geographically-focused reconnaissance — 
finding location-specific public resources (regional job pages, local subdomains, localized error pages).
